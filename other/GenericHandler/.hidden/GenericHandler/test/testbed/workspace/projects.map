# This is a projects map file for SmarTest 8 workspace.
# The format is 'key=value'
# Key is always Eclipse project name (please use only alphanumerical characters)
# Value is always a path string which can be written in 3 different ways:
# 1) For directories physically located *inside* workspace: relative path, like 'MyProject=my/project/path'
# 2) For directories physically located *outside* workspace:
# 2.1) $(environment_variable)/path, like 'MyProject=$(SRC_ROOT)/my/project/path' 
# 2.2) full absolute path (not recommended!)
