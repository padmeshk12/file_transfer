Additional Information for Handler Drivers

===============================================================================

This file contains additional information about the generic handler
driver. This is usually information that is not (yet) covered by the
official user documentation and configuration guide. In all cases of
questions you should first review the recommended documentation, which
is:

"Prober/Handler Drivers" (E7050-91036) and 
"Prober/Handler Drivers Configuration Guide" (E2790-91004)

Start of Delta Orion notes:

As of October 2004, the Orion Strip Handler is supported by the generic handler
driver.  

Configurations provided:
------------------------
Orion-GPIB-32.cfg

Important configuration settings for Orion:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
stop_handler_on_smartest_pause        |  Should be set to "no" since the Orion 
				      |  does not have a pause mode.  It simply
				      |  reacts to the next command after the
				      |  pause is done.  Setting to "yes" will
				      |  not change the behavior.
				      |
handler_site_ids                      |  Set this to reflect the number of sites
				      |  per strip for the device type to be tested.
				      |
handler_site_mask                     |  Set this to reflect the number of sites
				      |  per strip for the device type to be tested.
				      |
smartest_site_to_handler_site_map     |  Set this to reflect the number of sites
				      |  per strip for the device type to be tested.
				      |
automatic_reprobe_mode                |  The Orion has no concept of reprobe.
				      |  Instead, the strips that need to be 
				      |  retested are sent to the retest magazine
				      |  for testing at some later time.
				      |  Set this parameter to "off".  The
				      |  retest category is bin 0 on Orion.
				      |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Orion handler does not have temperature controls, so all the temperature
parameters in the configuration file are ignored.

The Orion-configured driver will send "testpartsready?" query to the handler to 
check if a strip is ready for test.  The handler can also send an SRQ to the
driver to indicate that a strip is ready for test.  In that case, the
driver will send the "testpartsready?" query to determine the strip population.
When testing is done, the driver will send a "testresults" command to assign a
bin number to each device on the strip.

* Tesec GPIB plugin

Configurations provided:
------------------------

Tesec-9588-GPIB-1.cfg
Tesec-9588-GPIB-2.cfg
Tesec-9588-GPIB-1-of-2.cfg

Supported handler models:
-------------------------

9588

Configuration specific settings
-------------------------------

The configurations differ in the number of sites they provide (1,2 or
1 of a dual site setup). The Tesec-9588-GPIB-1-of-2.cfg configuration
is an example how to use a handler that is setup for two sites
(mechanically) but only the second site is used for testing with a
single site test setup at the tester (it uses a site remapping of site
2). 

Important settings for all configurations are:


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              |
Debug level                   | 0, will log only basic messages, may be
                              | changed between -1 and 4
                              |
GPIB port used                | 14, must be changed to correct value based on
                              | the handlers setup (available with DIP switches
                              | on the handler's interface card)
                              |
bin mapping                   | default
                              |
number of bins                | 6 (SmarTest hardbins 0 through 5)
                              | bin 0 represents the SmarTest retest bin but 
                              | can not be send to the handler (the handler
                              | does not accept bin signal 0). Therefore
                              | there is no retest bin defined.
                              | For best convenience by using the default
                              | binning mode, SmarTest hard bins 1 to 4
                              | are mapped to handler bins 1 to 4. SmarTest
                              | hardbin 0 should not be used unless a 
                              | retest bin definition is added to the handler
                              | configuration file. The restest bin definition
                              | should match the production site specific
                              | usage of the handler.
                              | SmarTest hardbin no. 5 should also not be used
                              | since this is the sort signal usually used
                              | for reprobing.
                              |
reprobe mode                  | automatic reprobe on a per site mode, if
                              | devices fall into SmarTest reprobe bins.
                              | The handler only allows reprobing one time.
                              | If it receives two reprobe signals for the
                              | same device, it will sort the device to 
                              | a default location and present new devices.
                              | To use reprobing, it must be activated
                              | on the handler.
                              |
reprobe bin number            | 5, represents number sent to handler upon
                              | receiving a SmarTest reprobe bin. Must be 
                              | changed to correct value according to setup of 
                              | handler. Note that the reprobe mechanism 
                              | refers to the disconnection and reconnection 
                              | of the device before a retest is performed.
                              | To disable this setting remove the
                              | "handler_reprobe_bin" parameter and set the
                              | "automatic_reprobe_mode" to "off".
                              |
test start detection          | done by interrupt (SRQ)
                              |
end of line terminator        | driver sends CR+LF and EOI on the GPIB bus,
                              | can not be changed through configuration file.
                              | driver expects no special end of line code
                              | from handler expect EOI.
                              |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Startup conditions
------------------

At start up of the driver, the driver resets the GPIB bus to ensure
stable operation. If the handler receives the reset and has already
devices pending for test, it will bin these devices to a default
location. I.e. these devices are not tested. Therefore it is best
practice to start the test program on the tester first, before
handling of devices is activated at the handler.

GPIB Protocols
--------------

The Tesec 9588 provides two different GPIB protocol modes: The LTX
mode (GP-IB1 mode on the handler's menu) and the Theradyne mode
(GP-IB2) on the handler's menu. The LTX mode is old. To run with the
Tesec GPIB handler driver, the handler must be set to the Theradyne
mode. The two modes are not compatible.

GPIB communication flow
-----------------------

wait for devices: [<SRQ>]               The driver will wait for an SRQ.

                                        Waiting for devices repeats, until
                                        there is a device to test, performing
                                        status queries inbetween.

===============================================================================

SRQ:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      |
                      | <SRQ>           handler sends test start SRQ 0x4?
                      |                 where '?' represents the present
                      |                 devices in a bit field.
                      |                 0x40 is ignored by the driver.
===============================================================================


bin and reprobe devices:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      |
S<n><bins>Q           |                 driver sends bin information.
                      |                 <n> is one of 'A', 'B', .... indicating
                      |                 the number of bins (sites)
                      |                 <bins> is a list of '@', 'A', 'B', ...
                      |                 giving the bin results.
                      |                 E.g. SBACQ sends two devices to bin
                      |                 A (1) and B (2) respectively.
                      |                 If configured at handler, a special
                      |                 bin can be used to trigger a 
                      |                 reprobe operation (e.g. 'E' (5)).
                      |
